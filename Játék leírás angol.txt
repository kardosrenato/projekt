You need 2 players to play this game. This game is based on the game BlazBlue Calamity Trigger.
When the game starts both players have to choose a character, P1 from the left and P2 from the right side.
After that the game starts the players start at the same side as to which they chose the characters from.
Every character have 3 and half attacks(A,B,C,D attacks) attack A is a weak attack which deal low damage and have little range but you recover faster,
attack B deal mid damage on mid range and have a moderate recovery rate, attack C is your heavy attack it usually have a long range and high damage but takes longer to recover.
Now finally attack D its your Drive attack it differs from character to character for example lets look at Ragna(P1) and Haku-men(P2)
Ragna's drive deals the same amount of damage as a heavy attack twice and after every hit it recovers 1 hp, but on the other hand Haku-men's drive places a barrier which if gets hit with either a heavy
or drive attack it nullifies damage taken and deals 3 damage to the enemy.
On the right and left down side of the screen you can see a bar its your HEAT you get heat from dealing or taking damage.
Except if you are Haku-men cause he regenerates heat automatically.
Under your health and the timer you can see 2-2 squares it shows how much you won, it turns to red every time you win.
Now that you know the basics you can read the moves.
